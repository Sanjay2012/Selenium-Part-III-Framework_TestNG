What is Selenium Framework? Types of Framework?
 	 The Selenium Framework is a code structure that makes code maintenance easy and efficient.
  	 Without frameworks, users may place the “code” and “data” at the same location which is neither reusable nor readable. 
	Frameworks produce beneficial outcomes like increased code reusability, higher portability, reduced cost of script maintenance, better code readability, etc.

        There are mainly three type of frameworks created by Selenium WebDriver to automate manual test cases

	1. Data Driven
	2. Keyword Driven
	3. Hybrid

1. Data Driven
	Data Driven Framework in Selenium is a method of separating Test data from the test case.
	Once the Test data are separated from the test case, it can be easily modified for a specific functionality without changing the code. 
	It is used to fetch Test Data from external files like Excel, .csv, .xml or some database tables.
